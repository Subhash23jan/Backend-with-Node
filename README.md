# Backend Development Practice Repository

This repository contains all the practice content and exercises related to backend development. The focus is on building and understanding various backend technologies, including API creation, database handling, middleware usage, authentication, and more. Each section is organized into separate modules that demonstrate key backend development principles and patterns.

The code in this repository is written in **Node.js**, leveraging its powerful asynchronous features and rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. The repository covers multiple aspects of backend development, including but not limited to:

- **API Development**: Building RESTful APIs using frameworks like Express.js.
- **Database Integration**: Working with both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, including querying and connection setup.
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Proper error handling and structured logging for robust application performance.
- **Middleware**: Using middleware to handle requests, implement security features, and manage sessions.
- **Rate Limiting & Security**: Protecting APIs using rate limiting, CORS policies, and basic security practices.

This repository is structured to provide hands-on practice for backend developers, with each folder containing related content, organized and documented for easy understanding. It runs in a **Node.js environment**, meaning all examples and projects rely on Node.js as the runtime. Dependencies such as Express, Mongoose, Sequelize, and others can be installed and configured using `npm` or `yarn` package managers.
